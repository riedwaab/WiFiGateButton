# WiFiGateButton
Ardunio project using WiFi to control a Servo to push a gate remote control button

## This project uses
- Ardunio Uno
- ADAFruit CC3000 WiFi Shield
- SpringRC SM-S2309S

## Description
The WiFi Shield is used to listen for a specific GET request. When recieved a servo activates to push an normal remote control button. The more control button could do anything. In my case it pushes a Gate Remote. The purpose being to toggle the gate via WiFi without wiring into the gate conroller board.
